Valabind
========

Valabind is a tool to parse vala[1] or vapi files to transform
them into swig[2] interface files, C++ source files, GIR or GEAR[3].

With swig, you can create language bindings for any API
written in vala or C with a vapi interface.

It can also generate bindings for C++ and v8-GearBox[3].

Valabind mercurial repository is stored here:
